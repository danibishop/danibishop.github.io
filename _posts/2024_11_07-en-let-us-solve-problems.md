# Let us solve problems

My therapist showed me some definitions about emotions during our last session. There was a duet there that many of you think are pretty familiar with: happiness and sadness. She explained how most people mix happiness with euphoria and sadness with depression. She told me about the goal of the emotions, regarding our body and our life. You can buy this, research or dismiss it and it is totally legit, but I found truth in this. Mostly, because I already experienced it.

**Happiness is the driving force**. When you are happy, you are willing to do stuff. You want to climb that wall, to paint that miniature, to run that distance, to build that business...**Sadness is the breaks**. When you are sad, you need to stop something you are doing. It is that dashboard light telling you that you should check the tires, or refill gas, or check the temperature... If you keep driving all the time, overlooking the signals, you will crash or explode.

## I had to stop

I have been always quite public about my mental health since I was diagnosed with anxiety for the first time when I was 21. I learned how to control it and calm down so it does not get in the way. Three months ago, I could not control it during almost a week. People who only knew me for a year told me that I needed a break without even meeting in person. My wife told me that something was off; she was not sure about what, but that was not me.

I was sad.

## Why so sad?

Since I was very little, I always answered "an inventor" to the classic "What do you want to be when you grow up?" question. That "inventor" turned into "engineer" with the years and it turned into "a guy who fixes software stuff" when I quitted engineering school.

I have had bad paid jobs. I have had useless jobs. I have had shitty bosses. I have had clumsy managers. But never all at once. More or less, you had something to do, you tried your best and you got paid. There was some itch here and there but, most of the time, most things were mostly OK. And that is fine.

Three months ago, my body told me that I had to stop; that I was sad. Our company got acquired by some bigger company for peanuts half a year ago or so. Our CEO closed the operation and didn't even bother to do a Town Hall or similar; a Slack message was enough. Right after, most of our American colleagues got instantly laid-off. Then, half of the Spanish team was also fired. Then, after some weeks, another bunch of people was cut (funny enough: they were the first in a list if you ordered everybody in alphabetical order). Along with this, a lot of corpo BS was being pushed through our throats for no reason but for the sake of processes. Background image during calls, you were not allowed to discuss during CEO all hands, QA always ignored the tricky questions or naïve answers were given, ...

Our team was cut from 6 to 2. Our PO was let go. Our manager resigned after a couple of months.

I was working for a big pile of shit of a company. I was definitely sad.

## The illusion

We are told to work so we can earn. And we need to earn because food, housing, clothing, ... Surviving, you know. The logic behind this is that your work will bring some benefit to somebody and that somebody will pay you back (I won't even comment on the marxist view here and how wage theft is the biggest scam in history). That is quite true if you help your neighbor with some reparation, or if you have some person paying you to deliver some template to ease how they write emails, for example. BUT.

As you scale up, work and wage get unrelated. You can be working for years for a company with zero revenue and still get paid. And the logic there is that you are living on "future" benefits. But, how many companies under this scheme end up being profitable? Not so many. If you mix it with a post-pandemic flood of money from the US Federal Reserve, you get a lot of people getting salaries of 6, 7 or 8 figures for doing something that helps nobody and that won't be profitable ever.

This is what David Graeber described in Bullshit Jobs. In software, this is very relevant, as we live surrounded by senior developers, managers, VPs, POs, CTOs, ... and just a bunch of companies actually **do something**.
