## (re-)Learn to debug

> This post is also available in [Spanish](es-learn-to-debug.html).

> tl;dr: Instead of reading code or inserting "temporary" code, learn to debug. It's a skill that will make your life easier once you start using it. You don't even need to "master" it, just learn the basics and you'll be fine.

### What is not debugging?

* Don't use `console.log`. That is not debugging. That is bloating your code with temporary code that you'll have to remove later. It's also not very useful, because you can't inspect the values of variables, you can only print them.

### Python?

### React?
