## An agile budgeting proposal

> **THIS IS A WIP**

> tl;dr: Every project I have seen in outsourcing companies has a budget. But the budget is not agile. It's a static document that is not updated during the project. This is a draft of one of the potential solutions to this problem.

### Two problems

Let's say you have a nice self-managed team that adapts and delivers value at a fast pace to a costumer of a given service-provider company. You have achieved the Agile nirvana. Haven't you?

There was some bargaining between the service-provider and the costumer, and a **budget** was agreed upon, along with some broad scope and some high-level requirements to be delivered at a certain **deadline**. 

Problems appear when budget seems not to be enough and/or deadline is coming and the customer is not satisfied with the whatever the team has delivered.

Problems also appear then the customer's context changes so wildly that the original scope is no longer valid at all.

Problems also appear when the team is delivering but the customer feels that something is off. The team is not to blame, but the customer is not satisfied.

Should we keep the project going? Is the customer going to lose 100% of the budget regardless of the outcome? Is the provider going to lose 100% of the expected income plus the opportunity cost of blocking the team for a while?

I will explore here a potential solution to these problems. But first we need to define some constraints.

## Necessary conditions

* Customer **trusts** the team
* Customer will prefer a viable product over a perfect one if that means:
    * The product is delivered before the deadline
    * The product is delivered cheaper than the budget
* Customer assumes that the scope will change as both them and the team learn more about **what adds value**
* Provider is commited to educate the customer about the agile process
* Provider tries to maximize the project ROI (=maximize $/hour)
* Customer and provider assume that the context when starting a project **will** change during the execution of it and nobody should be blamed for that, nor charged.

## Hypothesis

This proposal is an equilibrium point between the customer's and the provider's interests. None of them will regret this agreement once the project starts in any reasonable scenario.

## The proposal

* Project can be negotiated as a regular waterfall project in terms of budget and deadline limitations, but these are just **boundary conditions**, not mandatory limits that must be reached.
    * This helps the sales team to sell the project using their regular sales pitch with some variation.
    * This helps the customer to understand the project in terms of their regular project management.

* The development will follow an iterative process where the customer **must** be an active part, providing feedback about value provided.

* All split conditions for the budget left are known and agreed upon by both parties. No surprises. No bargaining post-kickoff.

* If the feedback is bad during the early stages of the development, customer can retire saving most of the budget left, but not all of it. The team will be compensated for the work done and the blocked time (opportunity cost).
    * The earlier the customer retires, the more money they save but the less value they get.

* If the feedback is good during the development, the development will reach some point where the customer will decide that there is no more value to be added before reaching the deadline and the project can be considered **done**.

    * In this case, the customer can save part of the budget left, but not all of it. The team will be compensated for **early delivery** of the **highest possible value**.
    * The customer gets top-value in less time for less money.
    * The team gets higher compensation/effort ratio, plus more time to work on other projects (or to rest).


> The rule to calculate the compensation split for the available budget can be linear, quadratic, a LUT, ... whatever that fits the business model. For the examples, I will use a linear compensation for simplicity.

## One simple linear model

TBD

### Example: customer retires early because of external factors

TBD

### Example: maximum value is delivered way before deadline

TBD

### Example: maximum value is delivered before deadline

TBD

## Why there is no example for "project is about to reach deadline and customer is not satisfied with the value delivered"?

Because that scenario means that the agile process is not working in this project. Not meeting a deadline is something that can be predicted and avoided given the constraints I provided above.

I am not saying that this is not a real problem, I just say that it does not apply to this proposal in its current form.

## Why not predate the budget with a draconian contract?

Because our work is to deliver value, not to pay lawyers to write smart contracts. If you prefer to predate the budget in case of early retirement, go ahead. But then you are not in the software business, you are in the legal business.
