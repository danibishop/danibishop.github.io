# What Luke Skywalker thinks about your project

> *Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. The Rebellion is reborn today. The war is just beginning. And I will not be the last Jedi.* - Luke Skywalker

I am sure that most of you reading here can give this description when asked about "how do you organize your development process":

*Well, we do Scrum because we are Agile. We estimate the most important stories to know how much work can be done during the sprint. Then we start developing. Each developer takes a story and creates a branch on top of the development branch. When the task is done, the developer creates a pull request and the code is reviewed by the team. If everything is ok, the code is merged into the development branch. When the development branch is ready, we merge it into the master branch and deploy it to production.*

## First mistake: "We do Scrum because we are Agile"

Scrum is not Agile. Agile is [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/). Scrum is a wrapper to make XP (extreme programming) ["more palatable to management"](https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_engineering_room_9/)

## Second mistake : "We estimate the most important stories to know how much work can be done during the sprint"

## Third mistake: "Each developer takes a story"

ELLABORATE: pair/mob programming

## Fourth mistake: Doing Gitflow

This is not literal from the explanation but it is "common sense" nowadays in many organizations and teams.

Atlassian itself has stated that **GITFLOW IS OUTDATED**. As they state [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow): *"Gitflow is a legacy Git workflow"*

## Fifth mistake: pull requests

## Sixth mistake: Using a development branch

## Seventh mistake: Merging into master

ELLABORATE: mixing deploy and release

## Final thoughts

> *Search your feelings you know it to be true* - Darth Vader

- ELLABORATE -> There is no reference to delivered value in most of the explanations about the development process.
