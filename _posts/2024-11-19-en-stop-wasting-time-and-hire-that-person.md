**WIP**

# Stop wasting time and hire that person

> tl;dr: Current hiring time for software positions is in the order of weeks with (some times) multiple interviews and back-and-forth between members of a company. That is a waste of time. Just hire the first candidate that fits with the team at a personal level. Fire them if the technical level is not enough after a couple of weeks. It is more honest, respectful and cheaper.

## The current process

* It takes roughly 30 days to decide if a person will join the company. This is lower than some periods that people require before switching companies but we also know that, sometimes, people just want to have some slack between jobs. It would be nice to have excited candidates willing to join ASAP.
* A classic approach in tech companies is to have 3 or 4 calls:
  * First contact with recruiter. Usually, zero information for the candidate. This is just a way to save time for the company while gathering profiles... at a cost.
  * Tech assignment. This could be live or async. In any case, you need two or three people validating the work. For how long? Well, if taken seriously, several hours. If not taken seriously, why doing it? This is usually 1:many, where many is 2 or 3 tech people.
  * Hiring manager interview. This is usually 1:1 or 1:2 if the hiring manager gets support from some HR person or some "right hand"
  * Cultural fit. This is usually conducted with the whole team. 

## Current cost

For a single candidate, let's see cost assuming an average salary (and associated cost) as reference.

* Tech assignment. Assuming a proper review or interview, between 2 and 4 hours per involved colleague. If we involve 2 or three, we are talking about between 4 and 12 person·hours.
* Hiring manager. Maybe 1 hour? But this is usually at a higher cost. Lets count it as double. Indulge me. Total, 2 person·hours.
* Cultural fit. In software, this could mean between 2 and 5 people and could take between 1 and 2 hours. This means between 2 and 10 person·hours.

If we do not count the recruiter cost, we are talking **just internally** about between 8 and 24 person·hours of work. And that is **FOR A SINGLE CANDIDATE**.

## The funnel

How many candidates are interviewed before hiring? The process is usually a funnel, but we also know about places where you want to have an holistic approach unless you detect some red flag during the process. 

Recruiters tend to generate shortlists for positions and the size will vary a lot depending on how specific a role is. Some numbers say that conversion from interview to hiring is between 12% and 17%. Let's use a 15% for the sake of the argument. This means that you roughly interview 6 or 7 candidates before deciding. Let's take 7 to make numbers easier.

One candidate consumes all those 8/24 hours, but the rest don't make it to the final step. Let's split it evenly for the rest and assume 2 candidates are rejected in the first step, 2 in the second and other 2 in the third. Summing up and assuming the order of te interviews I described above:

* 7 x tech assignment = 7 x [4, 12] = [28, 84] person·hours
* 5 x hiring manager = 5x2 = 10 person·hours
* 3 x cultural fit = 3 x [2, 10] = [6, 30] person·hours

After this, only 1 candidate is hired after having spent between **44 and 124** person·hours. For typical 40 hours/week, this means the cost of **one person working between 1 and 3 weeks**.

And we cannot forget the opportunity cost and the multitasking of the actual crew. What is not being done and what gets interrupted is not being counted here.

## Churn

TBD

* So much effort for people who is leaving in XXX months on average?
* Devs are tired of neverending processes and assignments
* Do you measure performance and take action? No. Really.

* Internal promotion!
* Teaching tech stuff is way easier than making people fit at a personal level

## The alternative

The alternative I propose is very dependant on legal stuff and other regulations. I know the Spanish and USA landscapes, where firing somebody in the first months is... well... free.

* Skip the tech assignment and replace it with a short interview with your most trusted high-level engineer.
* Tech assigments are bullshit.They have always been. They are supposed to save time but that is not true. And tools like LeetCode are obsolete after coding AIs.
* Hire fast after an informal cultural interview. Organisations thrive thanks to organic growth thanks to personal relations.
* You can even sit many candidates at the same table for the cultural fit and evaluate the interactions in that environment.
* Trust the candidates. If you need to test them, that means you do not trust them. Why would you hire somebody you do not trust?
* Define a clear "testing period" of around 2 weeks. You must REALLY invest in evaluating the candidate during that period.
* Have a nice contract where it is specified what is expected during the testing period and that the candidate will be friendly fired if expectations are not met. We are all grown-ups.
* Don't kill the hiring process after hiring the first match. Keep it open and grow a good pool of candidates, just in case. You can even keep doing interviews at a slower pace and be ready to hire somebody if the current candidate does not match.

You will have 2 weeks to validate the candidate with **real work**
