# I help software teams to succeed

> Almost 20 years of software development experience focused on team building and quality assurance

## Building a team is not easy

* Developing software nowadays requires a lot of different expertises which means collaborating.
* This means building teams where each member has different culture, history, knowledge, schedule, life-style, ...
* These teams often require guidance, mentorship and well defined processes and practices to succeed
* I love helping teams to grow profesionally and succeed as part of a business

## Leading with kindness

* Technology is cool but having a life is cooler.
* Leading is not about commanding and using the whip; **leading is about understanding** and sharing the goods and bads.
* Leading is not about being x10 whatever; **leading is about helping others** reaching their goals.
* Leading is not about living for your job; **leading is about finding balance**.
